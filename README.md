# Call alerting for Intergraph I/NetViewer

This repository contains a TamperMonkey extension written for Syracuse
University Ambulance to parse calls from the Onondaga 911 center and play an
alert tone if the call is in the SUA service area.


*Note:* for this script to work in Google Chrome go to
chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy and set `Autoplay policy` to "No user gesture is
required".
